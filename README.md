# cdtwx

cdtwx displays weather forecasts and alerts for the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.

It looks good on mobile, since that's what you'll usually be using on the trail.

It grabs weather alerts and forecasts from the [National Weather Service API](https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/documentation).

It uses coordinates from [Bear Creek Survey + Jerry Brown's CDT GPX files](http://www.bearcreeksurvey.com/).

It only grabs weather conditions at Trailheads and Access Points. These locations are likely to be closer to cities and have more accurate forecasts. As always, the mountains create their own weather: use at your own risk.
